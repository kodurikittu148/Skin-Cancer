The incidence of skin cancer has been increasing at a very fast rate in the last few decades, and it is now one of the most prevalent and lethal illnesses in the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is a major cause of skin cancer due to excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and skin cancer can be in many various forms, including actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Specifically, melanoma is notorious for being virulent and having a high mortality rate if not treated. Thus, early detection and accurate classification of skin lesions are crucial to improving patient outcomes, reducing treatment costs, and saving lives. Traditional diagnostic methods primarily depend on invasive biopsies and dermatologists' visual inspections, which are time-consuming, subjective, and resource-intensive. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, has revolutionized medical imaging and diagnosis in the past few years. In object detection, segmentation, and classification tasks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a subcategory of deep neural networks that are specifically designed to process grid-like input such as photos, have yielded remarkable results. They are especially well-adapted to assess dermatological images due to their ability to extract hierarchical features from them automatically, including edges, textures, and complex patterns. CNNs are a potential replacement for conventional diagnostic techniques as they can be trained to distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions with great accuracy using large collections of labelled skin lesion images.
